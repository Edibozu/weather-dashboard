# Weather Dashboard

## Description

With this application, the user will be able to search for the current weather forecarst, depending on which city they have in mind. An added feature, it will also show a five day forecast, so the week can be planned accordingly, which would make taking vacations much easier.

## Contents

As of this moment, the application is still under construction, with the HTML and CSS files being complete. The JS file, which brings it to life, just needs a bit more time to work properly. 

The link for the application template will be provided. https://edibozu.github.io/weather-dashboard/
